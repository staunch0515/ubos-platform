# Conventions

## 1. Normative words

**shall** states a requirement that an implementation must meet to be accepted. **should**
states a recommendation; not meeting it must be recorded in the comparison data set with a
reason. **may** states a permitted option. Text outside the **Requirement** and
**Acceptance** fields, including notes and examples, is informative.

## 2. Identifiers

| Kind | Pattern | Example | Defined in |
|---|---|---|---|
| Requirement | `FIN-<AREA>-<NNN>` | `FIN-GL-012` | area files `02-…` to `13-…` |
| Role | `ROLE-<Name>` | `ROLE-Controller` | `01-scope-and-context.md` |
| Acceptance scenario | `FIN-SCN-<NN>` | `FIN-SCN-04` | `30-acceptance-scenarios.md` |
| Expected result | `FIN-EXP-<NN>` | `FIN-EXP-05` | `21-expected-results.md` |
| Comparison metric | `FIN-MET-<NN>` | `FIN-MET-03` | `40-comparison-protocol.md` |
| Document | `FIN-DOC-<NN>` | `FIN-DOC-02` | front matter of each file |

Areas: `GL` general ledger, `PC` periods and close, `AR` receivables, `AP` payables, `BK`
cash and bank, `FA` fixed assets, `FX` multi-currency, `TX` sales tax, `RP` reporting, `CT`
controls and audit, `SC` security and access, `DI` data and integration, `NF`
non-functional, `UI` user interface.

IDs are never renumbered or reused.

## 3. Requirement format

```
### FIN-GL-012 — Balanced entries
- **Requirement:** The system shall …
- **Priority:** Must | Should | Could
- **Basis:** the source of the requirement (standard, regulation or accepted practice)
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given …, when …, then ….
```

**Must** requirements are needed for acceptance of the implementation. **Should**
requirements are expected; each gap is recorded. **Could** requirements are optional and
are compared only when both implementations provide them.

## 4. Amounts, rounding and dates

1. Amounts are decimal, never binary floating point. Currency amounts have the minor units
   of their currency (USD 2 decimals). Exchange rates have at least 6 significant decimals.
2. Rounding is **half away from zero** to the currency's minor unit, applied at the level the
   requirement states (for example sales tax per invoice and jurisdiction, depreciation per
   asset and month).
3. Dates are calendar dates without time zone. Timestamps in the audit trail are UTC with
   at least millisecond precision and are shown in the company's time zone
   (America/Chicago for the sample company).
4. Display follows US conventions: `MM/DD/YYYY` by default, `1,234.56`, negative amounts in
   parentheses in financial statements and with a minus sign in data entry.

## 5. Two dates and one timeline

Every posted entry has a **posting date** (the accounting date that decides its period) and a
**recorded-on** timestamp (when it was entered into the books). A **document date** (the
date on the source document) may differ from both. Reports are "as of" a posting date and
"as known on" a recorded-on date (FIN-RP-020); by default "as known on" is now.

| IRS: 26 U.S.C. 6041 and 6041A, Forms W-9, 1099-NEC, 1099-MISC, 1096; backup withholding (26 U.S.C. 3406); Rev. Proc. 98-25 and IRS Publication 583 (record retention) | vendor tax data, information returns, retention of electronic records |

Tax rates, thresholds and form details change. They are configuration data with effective
dates and are confirmed by the owner against current official sources before each
acceptance run; they are never hard-coded.
