# UBOS Business Processing Architecture — System Specification

This is the **authoritative, self-contained specification** of the UBOS Business
Processing Architecture (BPA) and the systems built on it. It supersedes `docs/40-spec/`
as the current authority. The earlier volume is kept as history (DEC-008).

**The idea in one sentence:** UBOS standardises how business state changes over time.
State is typed, inheritable, versioned, bitemporal, governed and provable. Business policy
stays soft and versioned. Every contract or order runs as a standard **Business
Processing Unit (BPU)** on a **Data Virtual Machine (DVM)**.

## Tools

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/tools/regen_all.sh` | regenerate feature lists, traceability and indexes, then validate |
| `python3 docs/tools/check_system.py` | validate only (must report 0 errors before every commit) |
| `python3 docs/tools/gen_phase_features.py` | regenerate `50-phases/PH-*/01-features.md` |
| `python3 docs/tools/gen_traceability.py` | regenerate `60-verification/2*-trace*.md` |
| `python3 docs/tools/gen_indexes.py` | regenerate `INDEX/` |
