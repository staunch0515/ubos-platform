# Verification Volume — Suite Registry

## 1. Phase-level suites (defined here)

These suites combine system suites into the scenario, pilot and acceptance runs named by the
phase plans.

| Suite | Content | Methods | Phase | Trigger | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SUITE-PH1-SCN | the 13 PH-1 scenarios: gate-1a scenarios through the in-process binding, then all 13 over UBTP on a single-node Server | SCN | PH-1 | nightly from gate-1a start; release candidates | quality lead |
| SUITE-PH2-FUND | fund-operations scenarios SCN-101…110 (PH-2 subset) on the HA Server with WL-FUND-M and vertical fixtures | SCN, BENCH | PH-2 | nightly; release candidates | fund Buk lead |
| SUITE-PH2-CONTRACTS | contract scenarios SCN-201…208 (PH-2 subset) with WL-CONTRACT-M, including independent seal verification | SCN, INSP | PH-2 | nightly; release candidates | contracts Buk lead |
| SUITE-PH3-PILOT | pilot measurements: daily NAV parity, restatement, close, examination drill, agent acceptance and revert rates | PILOT, SCN | PH-3 | daily during the pilot | pilot lead |
| SUITE-PH4-PLATFORM | platform scenarios SCN-403, SCN-404, SCN-407, SCN-410 on Cells with CTL and EXC | SCN, FAULT | PH-4 | nightly; release candidates | platform lead |
