## 3. Open questions

| ID | Question | Status |
|---|---|---|
| OQ-001 | PH-1 carries 341 requirements (kernel breadth). Should PH-1 be split into PH-1a (store, model, versioning, transactions, logic) and PH-1b (rules, flow basics, events, IAM, proofs), each with its own exit gate? | Resolved by DEC-014 |
| OQ-002 | The first vertical covers fund operations and contracts in PH-2. Should either be deferred to PH-3 to shorten PH-2? | Resolved by DEC-015 |
| OQ-003 | Hosted Cell (PH-4) comes after Server (PH-1/PH-2). Is on-premises/private-cloud Server the confirmed first commercial form? | Resolved by DEC-016 |
