- **Verification:** CONF
- **Origin:** FR-DEV-011, FR-DEV-012

### DSN-FRG-002 — Project model
- **Statement:** A Forge project MUST be a directory with `forge.toml` and source folders `model/`, `sheets/`, `logic/`, `components/`, `views/`, `seed/`, `tests/`, `docs/`. Sources MUST be text formats (YAML or the textual grammars) so that they diff and merge in Git.

- **Origin:** FR-DEV-011, FR-PKG-011

### DSN-FRG-003 — Incremental build graph
- **Statement:** The build MUST compute a content-addressed dependency graph over sources and cache compiled outputs by input hash, so that a one-file change rebuilds only its dependants (FR-DEV-013).
