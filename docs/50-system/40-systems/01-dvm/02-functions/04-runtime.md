# DVM — Logic Runtime Design (DSN-DVM-6xx)

This file designs the crates `ubos-runtime` and `ubos-expr`.
Reading order:
1. instruction dispatch and the capability gateway (601–606);
2. execution tiers: expressions, Rhai, WASM (610–618);
3. profiles, metering and termination (620–625);
4. journal and replay (630–634);
5. logic assets and static analysis (640–646);
6. connectors (650–653);
7. `ask.model` (660–662).

## Instruction dispatch and the capability gateway

### DSN-DVM-601 — Single dispatch table
- **Statement:** All instructions of ABI 1.0 (STD-ISA-001) MUST be implemented once in `ubos-runtime` as handlers with the signature `fn(&mut ProcessCtx, Args) -> Result<Value, Error>`. The three tiers (expressions, Rhai, WASM) MUST call the same handlers through thin bindings, so behaviour is tier-neutral (STD-ISA-007).
- **Rationale:** One effect path (FR-LOGIC-014, FR-LOGIC-015).
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-KernelEngineer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given the instruction vectors, when executed through each tier, then results and errors are identical.
- **Verification:** CONF
- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-011, FR-LOGIC-013, FR-LOGIC-014, FR-LOGIC-015, STD-ISA-001, STD-ISA-007

### DSN-DVM-602 — Per-instruction pipeline
- **Statement:** Every handler invocation MUST pass these steps in order:
  1. ABI check (`LOGIC.ABI_UNSUPPORTED`);
  2. capability check against the asset's granted capabilities (`LOGIC.FORBIDDEN_CAPABILITY`);
  3. authorization decision (STD-ISA-005, DSN-DVM-801);
  4. metering charge (STD-ISA-004);
  5. execution;
  6. journaling of non-deterministic inputs;
  7. error normalisation (STD-ISA-006).
- **Rationale:** Uniform enforcement regardless of caller.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-SecurityOfficer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given an asset without `emit.notify`, when it calls the instruction, then `LOGIC.FORBIDDEN_CAPABILITY` is returned, and nothing is charged beyond the check.
- **Verification:** CONF, SEC
- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-023, STD-CTX-003, STD-ISA-004, STD-ISA-005, STD-ISA-006

### DSN-DVM-603 — Immutable context
- **Statement:** The execution context (DAT-ExecutionContext) MUST be constructed by the host API from authenticated data and MUST be exposed to logic as read-only. Any attempt to set identity, tenant, branch or time from logic MUST fail with `LOGIC.CONTEXT_IMMUTABLE`.
- **Rationale:** No self-declared identity (FR-LOGIC-022, STD-CTX-002).
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-SecurityOfficer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a script that sets `ctx.principal`, when run, then it fails, and the process aborts.
- **Verification:** SEC, CONF
- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-021, FR-LOGIC-022, STD-CTX-001, STD-CTX-002

### DSN-DVM-604 — Context propagation
- **Statement:** Nested calls (`run.port`, `run.logic`, `run.decision`) MUST inherit the parent context, with the capability set narrowed to the intersection of the caller's and callee's grants. `run.async` MUST create a new process with a derived context that records the parent process as trigger.
- **Rationale:** FR-LOGIC-024.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-LogicDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a port with capability C calling a port without C, when the inner port uses C, then it fails.
- **Verification:** CONF, SEC
- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-024, STD-ISA-050, STD-ISA-055

### DSN-DVM-605 — Instruction catalogue introspection
- **Statement:** The runtime MUST expose the instruction catalogue (name, family, determinism class, metering cost, required capability, availability phase) as reflection data, generated from the handler registry.
- **Rationale:** Tooling and agents get an exact catalogue.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM, FRG
- **Personas:** PER-LogicDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given the catalogue output, when compared with the standard's instruction list, then they match.
- **Verification:** INSP, CONF
- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-013, STD-ISA-001, STD-ISA-003

### DSN-DVM-606 — Business errors
- **Statement:** Logic MUST raise business errors through a single `fail(code, message, details)` instruction; the code MUST be declared in the asset's error list. Undeclared codes MUST be reported by static analysis.
- **Rationale:** FR-LOGIC-044.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-LogicDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a script raising a declared error, when run, then the process aborts, and the error object carries the code.
- **Verification:** CONF
- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-044, AR-026

## Execution tiers

### DSN-DVM-610 — Expression engine
- **Statement:** `ubos-expr` MUST parse the expression grammar (STD-EXPR-001), type-check it against the effective definition (STD-EXPR-002), and compile it to a compact bytecode evaluated by a stack machine. Compiled expressions MUST be cached by `(expression hash, model hash)`. Evaluation MUST be total (STD-EXPR-004) and use exact decimal arithmetic.
- **Rationale:** Fast, safe L1 logic for sheets, guards and filters.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-BusinessAnalyst
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given the expression vectors, when evaluated, then results equal the vectors, including null semantics.
  2. Given a typical guard expression, when evaluated 1,000,000 times, then the mean cost is below 1 µs.
- **Verification:** CONF, BENCH

- **Rationale:** FR-LOGIC-035.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-LogicDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given every library function, when called from an expression and a script with the same inputs, then results are identical.
- **Verification:** CONF
- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-035, STD-EXPR-005

### DSN-DVM-612 — Rhai host (L2)
- **Statement:** The L2 host MUST embed Rhai with the L2 profile of STD-CTX-020:
  - no filesystem, network, time or random functions;
  - floating point disabled (`LOGIC.FLOAT_TO_DECIMAL` on conversion attempts), decimal type from `ubos-expr`;
  - operation and call-depth limits mapped to metering units;
  - typed object handles generated from effective definitions (`LOGIC.UNKNOWN_FIELD`, `LOGIC.TYPE_ERROR`).

  Compiled ASTs MUST be cached by asset version hash.
- **Rationale:** Productive scripting with determinism.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-LogicDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given the L2 sandbox test suite, when run, then no forbidden capability is reachable.

### DSN-DVM-613 — Script modules and imports
- **Statement:** Scripts MAY import modules by pinned asset version (FR-LOGIC-043). The loader MUST resolve imports from the snapshot, reject unpinned imports on protected branches, and detect cycles.
- **Rationale:** Reproducible logic composition.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-LogicDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a script importing module v1.2, when v1.3 is published, then the script still runs v1.2.
- **Verification:** CONF
- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-043, STD-CTX-030

### DSN-DVM-614 — WASM host (L3)
- **Statement:** The L3 host MUST use wasmtime with the component model and the world of STD-CTX-021. It MUST enable fuel metering and epoch interruption, cap linear memory per profile, disable non-deterministic features (threads, relaxed SIMD) and canonicalise NaNs. Components MUST be pre-compiled per host CPU class and cached by `(component hash, engine version)`.
- **Rationale:** Language-neutral, sandboxed, metered heavy logic.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-3 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-IsvDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given the L3 escape test suite, when run, then no escape is possible.

- **Rationale:** FR-LOGIC-054.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-3 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-SecurityOfficer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a component with one byte changed after signing, when loaded, then it is rejected.
- **Verification:** SEC
- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-054, STD-CTX-023

### DSN-DVM-616 — Tenant isolation in execution
- **Statement:** Rhai engines and WASM stores MUST NOT be shared across tenants. Instance pools MUST be keyed by tenant; memory MUST be zeroed when an instance is returned to a pool.
- **Rationale:** FR-LOGIC-065, NR-SEC-003.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-SecurityOfficer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a script that leaves data in globals, when another tenant's script runs next on the same node, then the data is not observable.
- **Verification:** SEC
- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-065, NR-SEC-003

### DSN-DVM-617 — Execution off the async reactor
- **Statement:** Logic execution MUST run on a dedicated bounded thread pool, never on the host's async I/O reactor threads. The pool size MUST default to the number of cores.
- **Rationale:** Long scripts do not block I/O.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM, NOD
- **Personas:** PER-PlatformOperator
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given 64 scripts at the strict CPU limit, when running, then health endpoints still answer within 50 ms.
- **Verification:** BENCH
- **Origin:** NR-AVAIL-005

### DSN-DVM-618 — Hot swap of logic
- **Statement:** A new logic asset version MUST become active atomically at the commit that activates it; processes that started earlier MUST continue with their pinned version (STD-CTX-030).
- **Rationale:** FR-LOGIC-085.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-LogicDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a long process running v1, when v2 is activated, then that process finishes on v1, and new processes use v2.
- **Verification:** CONF

## Profiles, metering and termination

### DSN-DVM-620 — Profile table
- **Statement:** The runtime MUST enforce the five profiles of STD-CTX-004 from a configuration table (wall time, CPU fuel, memory, instruction count, call depth, external calls, staged writes). The standard profile default MUST be 3,000 ms and 512 MB. Tenants MAY tighten but not loosen limits beyond the plan's ceiling.

### DSN-DVM-621 — Uncatchable termination
- **Statement:** Limit breaches, cancellations (`LOGIC.CANCELLED`) and sandbox faults MUST terminate the whole process and discard its staging area; logic MUST NOT be able to catch them (STD-CTX-005).
- **Rationale:** FR-LOGIC-062.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-SecurityOfficer
- **Acceptance:**

- **Origin:** FR-LOGIC-062, STD-CTX-005

### DSN-DVM-622 — Metering record
- **Statement:** Each process MUST produce a `MeteringRecord` (STD-CTX-006) with units per instruction family, CPU fuel, peak memory, wall time and external calls, stored with the commit or with the abort record, and exported to the host for billing and cost attribution.
- **Rationale:** FR-LOGIC-063, NR-COST-004.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** DVM, NOD
- **Personas:** PER-PlatformOperator
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given 1,000 processes, when their metering records are summed, then they equal the host's billed units.

### DSN-DVM-624 — Quarantine
- **Statement:** Assets whose failure rate over a sliding window exceeds a threshold (default 50% of at least 20 runs) MUST be quarantined automatically (STD-CTX-031); calls MUST then fail with `LOGIC.ASSET_QUARANTINED` until a governed release.
- **Rationale:** FR-LOGIC-064.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-2 · **Systems:** DVM
- **Personas:** PER-PlatformOperator
- **Acceptance:**

## Journal and replay

### DSN-DVM-630 — Execution journal
- **Statement:** Each process MUST produce a journal (STD-CTX-011) recording: the context, the snapshot map, asset versions, every non-deterministic input (clock reads, entropy, connector responses, model responses) and the outcome hash.

## `ask.model`

### DSN-DVM-660 — Model call path
- **Statement:** `ask.model` (STD-ISA-100) MUST check the classification of every input field against the provider allow-list (`AI.CLASSIFICATION_BLOCKED`), charge the AI budget (`AI.BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`), delegate the call to the host model gateway, and validate the output against the declared schema (`AI.OUTPUT_INVALID`).
