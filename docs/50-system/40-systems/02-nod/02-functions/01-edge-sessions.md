Reading order:
1. process architecture (001–008);
2. UBTP server (010–019);
3. REST facade and webhooks (030–037);
4. authentication and sessions (101–112);

6. secrets and keys (130–139);
7. API credentials and delegated clients (150–153).

## Process architecture

### DSN-NOD-001 — Async host with isolated execution pool
- **Statement:** `ubos-node` MUST run on a Tokio multi-threaded runtime for I/O and MUST dispatch DVM processes to the bounded execution pool (DSN-DVM-617). Blocking storage calls MUST use the async `sqlx` driver (PostgreSQL) or a dedicated SQLite writer thread. No handler MAY block an I/O thread for more than 1 ms.
- **Rationale:** Predictable latency under mixed load (NR-AVAIL-005).
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-PlatformOperator

### DSN-NOD-002 — Per-tenant fairness
- **Statement:** The execution pool MUST schedule work by weighted fair queuing across tenants, with weights from the tenant plan and per-tenant concurrency caps. A tenant exceeding its cap MUST queue, not fail, until the queue wait exceeds the profile limit, then fail with `OPS.QUOTA_EXCEEDED`.
- **Rationale:** FR-TEN-024, NR-PERF-022.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-2 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-PlatformOperator
- **Acceptance:**

### DSN-NOD-131 — Envelope encryption hierarchy
- **Statement:** The key hierarchy MUST be: root KEK (KMS, HSM or OS key store) → tenant KEK → tenant data keys (chunk AEAD, secret store) and subject keys (DSN-DVM-830). Data keys MUST be cached in memory for at most 1 hour.
- **Rationale:** FR-IAM-092, NR-SEC-006.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-SecurityOfficer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given the root KEK revoked, when the cache expires, then encrypted reads fail with `IAM.KEY_UNAVAILABLE`.
- **Verification:** SEC, FAULT
- **Origin:** FR-IAM-092, NR-SEC-006

### DSN-NOD-132 — KMS adapters and customer-managed keys
- **Statement:** The key service MUST support AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud KMS, HashiCorp Vault Transit, PKCS#11 HSMs and a local file-based KEK (development only). Customer-managed keys MUST be configurable per tenant (FR-IAM-093).
- **Rationale:** FR-IAM-093.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-2 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-SecurityOfficer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a tenant with a customer-managed key that the customer disables, when data is read, then reads fail, and the Control Plane shows the tenant as key-locked.
- **Verification:** SEC
- **Origin:** FR-IAM-093

### DSN-NOD-133 — Rotation
- **Statement:** Tenant KEKs MUST be rotatable online by re-wrapping data keys; data keys MUST be rotatable by writing new chunks with the new key and lazily re-encrypting on read or by a background job (FR-IAM-094). Content IDs never change on rotation (DSN-DVM-002).
- **Rationale:** FR-IAM-094.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-2 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-SecurityOfficer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a KEK rotation on a tenant with 10 M chunks, when completed, then all data is readable, and roots are unchanged.
- **Verification:** SEC, CONF
- **Origin:** FR-IAM-094, AR-020

### DSN-NOD-134 — Signing service
- **Statement:** The signing service (IF-DVM-055) MUST sign with custodial keys unwrapped in memory (at most 1 hour) or delegate to an HSM. Each signature operation MUST be counted per principal for anomaly detection.
- **Rationale:** DSN-DVM-520, NR-SEC-006.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-SecurityOfficer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given 1,000 commits per second, when signed with custodial keys, then signing adds under 0.2 ms p95.
- **Verification:** BENCH
- **Origin:** NR-SEC-006, STD-PROOF-010

### DSN-NOD-135 — Subject key destruction
- **Statement:** Destroying a subject key MUST remove it from the key store, add a tombstone that key-store restores apply (DSN-DVM-832), and produce an erasure certificate.
- **Rationale:** FR-PROOF-073, FR-PROOF-074.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-3 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-ComplianceOfficer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a key-store restore from before a destruction, when completed, then the tombstone is re-applied.
- **Verification:** FAULT, SEC
- **Origin:** FR-PROOF-073, FR-PROOF-074

## API credentials and delegated clients

### DSN-NOD-150 — API keys
- **Statement:** API keys MUST be random 256-bit secrets shown once, stored hashed, bound to a principal, scopes and optional IP ranges, with expiry (FR-IAM-012, FR-INT-082).
- **Rationale:** FR-IAM-012, FR-INT-082.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-IsvDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a key used from an unlisted IP, when called, then it is rejected, and a security event is logged.
- **Verification:** SEC
- **Origin:** FR-IAM-012, FR-INT-082

### DSN-NOD-151 — OAuth client credentials
- **Statement:** The node MUST act as an OAuth 2.1 authorization server for client credentials and authorization code with PKCE for delegated clients (FR-INT-081, FR-IAM-104), issuing short-lived access tokens (default 15 minutes) with scopes.
- **Rationale:** FR-INT-081, FR-IAM-104.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-2 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-IsvDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given an expired token, when used, then HTTP 401 is returned with a clear error.
- **Verification:** SEC, CONF
- **Origin:** FR-INT-081, FR-IAM-104

### DSN-NOD-152 — Rotation without downtime
- **Statement:** Credentials MUST support two concurrently valid secrets during a rotation window (FR-INT-083, FR-INT-044).
- **Rationale:** FR-INT-083.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-2 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-IsvDeveloper
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a rotation, when both old and new secrets are used during the window, then both work; after it, only the new one.
- **Verification:** CONF
- **Origin:** FR-INT-083, FR-INT-044

### DSN-NOD-153 — Scope enforcement
- **Statement:** Credential scopes MUST be intersected with the principal's permissions in the DVM context, so a credential can never exceed its principal.
- **Rationale:** Least privilege for integrations.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** NOD
- **Personas:** PER-SecurityOfficer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a read-only scope, when a mutation is attempted, then it is denied even though the principal could write.
- **Verification:** SEC
- **Origin:** FR-INT-082, FR-IAM-041
