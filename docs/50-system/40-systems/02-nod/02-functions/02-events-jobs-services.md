## Outbox release and event delivery

### DSN-NOD-201 — Outbox releaser
- **Statement:** Each node MUST run an outbox releaser that claims ready rows through `outbox_claim` (IF-DVM-033) with a lease (default 30 s), delivers them to their destinations (subscriptions, event handlers, webhooks, notifications, brokers, connectors), and acknowledges. Releasers on several nodes MUST partition work by aggregate-key hash so that per-key order holds.

### DSN-NOD-202 — Event log
- **Statement:** Declared events (FR-EVT-011) and standard lifecycle events (FR-EVT-012) MUST be appended to an event log table after release, retained per event-type policy (FR-EVT-015), and queryable by type, object and time.
