# PH-1 — Kernel and Single-Node Server

## 1. Goal and business value

PH-1 builds the reference kernel (DVM) to production quality and wraps it in a single-node
Server and a headless Box, so that the mechanism is proven end to end: typed, inherited,
bitemporal, branchable, provable business state with deterministic governed logic. It
delivers business goal **G1** (UBS-REQ-01 §7): 100% of the BPA conformance vectors of the
claimed profiles pass on the reference DVM on PostgreSQL and on SQLite.

PH-1 has two sequential gates (DEC-014):
- **PH-1a Engine core** — the kernel and its in-process host: storage, model, versioning,
  time, ledger, transactions, L1/L2 runtime, proofs, portable export and import, Forge
  check/types/test, headless Box host services.
- **PH-1b Governance and services** — governance sheets, decisions, lifecycles and ports,
  events and jobs, queries with authorization, UBTP server, SDKs, local identity, secrets,
  single-node Server operations, and an engineering UI for acceptance.

Measurable outcomes:
1. BPA 1.0-rc conformance: 100% of vectors of Core, Bitemporal, Ledger, Proof (roots,
   signatures, inclusion) and Governance profiles pass on PostgreSQL and SQLite
   (MET-QUAL-010).
2. PH-1 NR performance targets met on ENV-REF-SERVER (MET-PERF-010…017).
3. 0 lost acknowledged commits in 10,000 injected crashes (NR-DUR-001, MET-QUAL-013).
4. 100% replay fidelity on 10,000 processes (NR-DET-001, MET-QUAL-014).
5. All 13 PH-1 scenarios pass on a single-node Server (MET-QUAL-015).

## 2. Systems and components in scope

| System | Components | Gate | Depth |
|---|---|---|---|
| BPA | 1.0-rc clauses for Core, Bitemporal, Ledger, Proof (subset), Governance; vectors covering all MUST clauses of these profiles | 1a, 1b | extended |
| DVM | all engine crates at production quality for storage, model, versioning, time, ledger, transactions, runtime (L1, L2), proofs, export/import (1a); rules, flow core, authorization (RBAC, ABAC), query, view resolution basics (1b) | 1a, 1b | new |
| NOD | headless Box host and CTR-002 host services (1a); Server single node: UBTP server, local authentication, sessions, secrets, jobs, schedules, outbox release, events, blobs, telemetry, health, backup and PITR, configuration, genesis Buks (1b) | 1a, 1b | new |
| FRG | check, types, test, verification records for L2, conformance runner, `forge dev` (1b) | 1a, 1b | new |
| SDK | Rust and TypeScript SDKs over UBTP | 1b | new |
| WSP | engineering UI (generated forms, lists, details, history) used only for acceptance | 1b | prototype |
| NTY | verifier library functions (inclusion proofs, signatures) | 1a | prototype |

## 3. Feature list

The generated list is UBS-PHF-1: 304 FR, 32 NR, 5 CR and 13 scenarios, each tagged with its
gate. Gate assignment of FR follows DEC-014 (domains and capability exceptions). Gate
assignment of NR and CR follows this rule: NR areas DET, MAINT, PORT and COMPAT, and the
items NR-PERF-001, -002, -004, -005, -006, -007, -010, NR-DUR-001, NR-SEC-002 and
NR-SEC-004 are verified at gate 1a; all other PH-1 NR and CR items at gate 1b.

Scenario assignment to gates:

| Gate | Scenarios |
|---|---|
| 1a (verified through the in-process binding and Forge tests) | SCN-002, SCN-003, SCN-004, SCN-005, SCN-006, SCN-007, SCN-008, SCN-010, SCN-011, SCN-018 |
| 1b (verified on a single-node Server through UBTP and SDKs) | SCN-001, SCN-009, SCN-017, and a re-run of all 1a scenarios over UBTP |

Design coverage: all DSN-DVM items with **Phase** PH-1; DSN-NOD items with **Phase** PH-1;
DSN-FRG-001…004, DSN-FRG-101…103, DSN-FRG-201…204, DSN-FRG-401…404, DSN-FRG-501;
DSN-SDK items with **Phase** PH-1; DSN-BPA-003, DSN-BPA-004, DSN-BPA-010.

| scenarios | all 13 PH-1 scenarios pass over UBTP on ENV-REF-SMALL |

### 7.5 Acceptance

Gate 1a is accepted by the Phase Acceptance Board with the engineering, quality and security
leads, on the evidence of signed runner reports, simulation and fault reports, benchmark
reports and the coverage report. Gate 1b is accepted by the same board plus the operations
lead, adding the scenario run report and the security report. Both acceptances are recorded
as DEC entries.

### 7.6 Regression policy

From gate 1a, every kernel pull request runs the fast conformance subset (≤ 10 minutes),
properties (short mode) and the dependency-graph check; every night runs the full vectors,
properties (long mode), 10,000 simulation seeds and the benchmark suite. A benchmark
regression over 10% or any simulation failure blocks the next release candidate.

## 11. Reference duration and team assumption

Non-normative. 9 months: gate 1a after 5 months, gate 1b after 4 more. Team of 10–12
engineers: 5 kernel (Rust), 1 formal methods, 2 node/host, 1 SDK/TypeScript, 1 quality and
performance, 1 security (half-time), the standards steward, the engineering lead and the
product owner.
