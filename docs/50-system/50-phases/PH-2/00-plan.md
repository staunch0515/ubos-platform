# PH-2 — First Business Package (Basic Finance) and Production Server

## 1. Goal and business value

PH-2 delivers the first complete product (DEC-016 as revised by DEC-023): a highly available
Server with a professional Web Workspace, a lean Studio and Bridge, and the first business
package — the **Basic Finance** Buk, a US-standard general-ledger, receivables, payables, bank,
fixed-asset, multi-currency and close system for one company (DEC-022). The product is not
sold; it exists to demonstrate what the platform imposes on every business package
(versioned history, maker–checker, "as known on" queries, simulation, evidence, explanations)
and to be compared with the same requirements implemented in the owner's Java system
(DEC-026). It delivers business goal **G2**: the finance package runs with zero kernel code
specific to it. It also completes the governance kernel (lenses, decision tables, approvals,
workflows, sagas, ReBAC, masking, crypto-shredding, simulation, periods and close, matching)
and the production edge (REST, webhooks, SSO, SCIM, notifications, files, search).

Measurable outcomes:
1. The Basic Finance Buk passes SCN-501…510 on an HA Server, and the financial statements
   of the sample company equal the independently computed expected results (MET-BIZ-003),
   with 0 lines of finance-specific kernel code (MET-BIZ-001).
2. BPA 1.0 final is released with vectors for all PH-2 kernel features, on PostgreSQL
   (MET-QUAL-020, DEC-024).
3. Usability with accountants: ≥ 90% unassisted task success and SUS ≥ 75 (NR-USE-001,
   NR-USE-002), and keyboard-first journal entry in the Smart Grid (FR-OFFICE-041…046).
4. HA and DR: node loss causes no failed requests beyond retries; RPO/RTO met (NR-AVAIL-002,
   NR-DUR-002, NR-DUR-003).
5. The sample company's opening balances and one year of history are migrated from
   spreadsheet and CSV extracts with a reconciliation report showing 0 unexplained
   differences (MET-BIZ-002).
6. Development-effort and defect data are recorded under the comparison protocol
   (MET-BIZ-004, DEC-026).

## 2. Systems and components in scope

Not in scope: SQLite, Box, desktop and mobile apps (PH-4, DEC-024, DEC-025); the deferred
fund-operations and contract packages (DEC-022).

## 3. Feature list

The generated list is UBS-PHF-2: 265 FR, 52 NR, 15 CR and 17 scenarios. Design coverage: all
DSN items with **Phase** PH-2 across DVM, NOD, FRG, SDK, WSP, STU and BRG.

The Basic Finance Buk is specified by the scenario family SCN-501…510 (PH-2 part of
UBS-REQ-04-06) and by the implementation-neutral finance requirements
(`docs/finance-requirements/`, DEC-026). It is built only from kernel features; any kernel gap
found while building it is raised as a standard change (DSN-BPA-010), never as
finance-specific kernel code. The generic scenarios SCN-012…016 use finance examples.

## 4. Dependencies

| Dependency | Kind | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| EXIT-1-01…20 | prior exit | start |

| accessibility auditor and usability-study participants (accountants, controllers, clerks; ASM-013) | external | month 6 |
| penetration-test vendor | external | month 8 |

## 5. Out of scope for this phase

Datasets: the Northwind sample company with expected results (UBS-VER-03), WL-FIN-M (finance
workload), WL-GENERIC-10M scaled to NR-SCAL-001 PH-2 size (50,000,000 current objects), bank
statement and payment file fixtures, and the rendering vector set.

### 7.5 Acceptance

The Phase Acceptance Board accepts PH-2. The accounting reviewer signs the expected results
and the accounting-correctness report. The owner signs the comparison data set for PH-2.
Records are DEC entries with evidence hashes.

### 7.6 Regression policy

All PH-1 suites and scenarios re-run on every PH-2 release candidate; kernel minors must
pass the finance Buk's scenarios before release (NR-COMPAT-004).

## 10. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Description | L | I | Mitigation | Early warning | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSK-020 | Finance package needs a kernel feature not in the standard | H | M | fast standard change process with vectors; kernel team embedded with Buk team | Buk backlog items tagged "kernel gap" > 5 open | product owner |
| RSK-021 | Accountants find branching concepts confusing (ASM-007) | M | H | progressive disclosure, accounting vocabulary, early usability tests at month 3 and 6 | SUS < 70 in the month-3 test | design lead |
| RSK-022 | **Withdrawn** (DEC-023): no design partner in PH-2 | — | — | — | — | — |
| RSK-023 | Lens and schema-merge complexity causes defects | M | H | property tests with generated schemas; FORM for schema alignment | property failures in nightly runs | kernel lead |
| RSK-024 | Accessibility retrofitting late | M | M | accessible widget catalogue from the start; axe checks in CI | axe violations trending up | design lead |
| RSK-025 | **Withdrawn** (DEC-022): E-SIGN ceremony moves to PH-5 | — | — | — | — | — |
| RSK-026 | Accounting errors in the Buk (rounding, currency revaluation, period cut-off, 1099 thresholds) go unnoticed because the team lacks accounting expertise | M | H | expected results computed independently and signed by the accounting reviewer; property tests that debits equal credits; statement tie-outs in every scenario | any statement difference from the expected results | Buk lead |
| RSK-027 | Comparison with the Java system is not like for like (different scope, team or effort recording) | M | M | one requirement document, one sample company, one recording protocol (DEC-026); scope differences logged per requirement | comparison records missing for > 10% of work items | product owner |

## 11. Reference duration and team assumption

Non-normative. 9 months. Team of 12–14: 4 kernel, 3 node/platform, 3 front-end (WSP, STU),
2 Buk developers with an accounting analyst, 1 Forge, 1 quality, 1 security, plus design, the
standards steward, the engineering lead and the product owner. The growth beyond the 8–12
core follows ASM-001.
