## 3. TypeScript packages

| Package | Responsibility | May depend on |
|---|---|---|

| `@ubos/render` | widget catalogue renderers (React), view protocol | `@ubos/sdk` |

| `@ubos/verify-web` | static web verifier | `ubos-verify` compiled to WASM |

### AR-031 — Enforced dependency graph
- **Rule:** The crate and package dependency graph in sections 2 and 3 is normative. CI MUST fail on any dependency not listed.
- **Realises:** NR-MAINT-003, AR-001
- **Rationale:** Architecture erosion is prevented mechanically.

### AR-032 — Engine crates are pure with respect to I/O
- **Rule:** Engine-layer crates MUST NOT perform network, file-system or clock access except through host-service traits (CTR-002) and storage traits.
- **Realises:** AR-002, FR-LOGIC-071
- **Rationale:** Determinism, testability, WASM compilation.

## 4. Build and quality gates (CI)

| Gate | When | Blocks merge |
|---|---|---|
| Format, lint (`cargo fmt`, `clippy -D warnings`, `eslint`, `tsc --strict`) | every change | yes |
| Unit and property tests (quick profile) | every change | yes |
| Dependency-graph check | every change | yes |
| Conformance vectors for the changed crates' profiles | every change | yes |
| Full conformance, cross-backend (PostgreSQL and SQLite) | every merge to main | yes (for the release branch) |
| Deterministic simulation (short seeds) | every merge to main | yes |
| Deterministic simulation (long runs), fault injection matrix | nightly | release blocker if red |
| Isolation and sandbox-escape suites | nightly and release | release blocker |
| Benchmarks with regression thresholds (±5% from baseline) | nightly | release blocker if outside threshold without an approved DEC |
| Scenario suites on all bindings | release candidate | yes |
| SBOM, signing, provenance | release | yes |

## 5. Release trains

| Artefact | Cadence | Support |
|---|---|---|
| BPA standard | minor every 6 months; patches as needed | major ≥ 24 months after the successor (FR-STD-041) |
| Kernel and node | minor every 6–8 weeks; patches as needed | the current and previous minor; LTS minor yearly (18 months support) |
| SDKs | aligned with protocol minors | N and N−1 servers (NR-COMPAT-002) |
| Clients (WSP, STU) | continuous for hosted; aligned with node minors for Server | the widget catalogue is negotiated |
| First-party Buks | independent semantic versions | tested against the supported kernel minors (NR-COMPAT-004) |

### AR-033 — Standard before code
- **Rule:** Any change to kernel semantics MUST first land as a BPA change with conformance vectors (CST-013). Implementation merges only when the new vectors pass.
- **Realises:** FR-STD-011, FR-STD-022
- **Rationale:** The standard is the product. Code follows it.

## 6. Reuse of the source repositories

The eight research repositories are inputs, not a codebase to extend (DEC-018). Code from
them MAY be ported into the monorepo crate by crate when all of the following hold:
1. It matches the specification.
2. It passes the relevant conformance vectors.
3. Its design is recorded against the `DSN-*` items it implements.

The analysis in `docs/20-analysis/` names the most mature sources:
- `ubos-system` and `logrum-system` for the store, protocol and packages;
- `ubos_core` for jobs, anchors and loaders.
