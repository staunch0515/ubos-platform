# Annex — Basic Finance Requirements Mapped to the Platform

The implementation-neutral finance requirements live in `docs/finance-requirements/`
(DEC-026). They use their own IDs (`FIN-<AREA>-<NNN>`) and never refer to the platform. This
annex states, per finance area, which platform capabilities, requirements, design items and
scenarios realise them on UBOS, and which part is **Buk content** (classes, rules, views and
reports of the `finance` Buk) rather than kernel or system functionality. Nothing in the
finance area may add finance-specific kernel code (EXIT-2-04).

## 2. Beyond the finance requirements

Some platform capabilities go beyond what the finance requirements ask and are shown in the
PH-3 scenarios: anchored evidence packs verified offline by the CPA (SCN-511) and finance
agents working under review (SCN-512). They are measured under FIN-MET-12 and reported as
additional capability in the comparison, not as requirement coverage.

## 3. Acceptance on the platform

The platform passes the finance requirements when SUITE-PH2-FINANCE runs the finance
acceptance scenarios on the HA Server and reproduces every expected result of the sample
company (EXIT-2-16). The comparison data are recorded under the protocol of the finance
requirements (EXIT-2-19, EXIT-3-15).
