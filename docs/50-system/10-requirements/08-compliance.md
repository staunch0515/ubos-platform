# Compliance Requirements

This catalogue translates regulations and frameworks into platform obligations. It follows
DEC-003: US first, GDPR designed in.

- The **Control reference** field cites the regulation or control.
- UBOS provides *capabilities* that let customers comply. Customers remain responsible for
  their own compliance programmes.
- Items marked `AUDIT` require third-party attestation.

> Informative note: the control references summarise the regulations for requirements
> purposes. Legal counsel MUST confirm interpretations before customer-facing claims are
> made.
