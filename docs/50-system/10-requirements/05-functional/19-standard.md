# Functional Requirements — STD

The BPA is a product of its own: a published, language-neutral standard with a
conformance suite and a certification programme. This is the basis of the "ARM
architecture of business logic" positioning (EXT-BPU, UBS-META-06 §4).

## CAP-STD-01 — Standard versioning

### FR-STD-011 — Versioned releases of the standard
- **Statement:** The BPA MUST be published in versioned releases (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). Each release MUST include:
  - the normative text and the grammars and schemas;
  - the conformance vectors;
  - a change log and a compatibility statement.
- **Rationale:** A standard others can implement against.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-0 · **Systems:** BPA
- **Personas:** PER-StandardsSteward, PER-ThirdPartyImplementer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a release, when inspected, then every listed component is present and consistent.
- **Verification:** INSP
- **Origin:** EXT-BPU, EXT-RFC

### FR-STD-012 — Errata process
- **Statement:** Ambiguities and defects MUST be handled through a public errata process with IDs, status and resolution, reflected in PATCH releases.
- **Rationale:** Standards need maintenance.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-0 · **Systems:** BPA
- **Personas:** PER-StandardsSteward
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given a reported ambiguity, when resolved, then the erratum is published with the clarified text and new vectors.
- **Verification:** INSP
- **Origin:** NEW

### FR-STD-013 — Normative language and structure
- **Statement:** The standard MUST use RFC 2119 keywords, stable clause IDs (`STD-*`), ABNF grammars and JSON Schemas, and MUST mark informative text explicitly.
- **Rationale:** Precision for implementers and AI.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-0 · **Systems:** BPA
- **Personas:** PER-ThirdPartyImplementer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given the standard, when linted, then every normative clause has an ID.
- **Verification:** INSP
- **Origin:** EXT-RFC

### FR-STD-014 — Profiles
- **Statement:** The standard MUST define conformance profiles, at least:
  - `Core`: model, versioning, transactions, instruction set, expressions;
  - `Bitemporal`;
  - `Ledger`;
  - `Governance`: LGS and policy decisions;
  - `Proof`;
  - `Sync`;
  - `Browser`.

  An implementation claims profiles individually.
- **Rationale:** Incremental adoption by implementers.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-0 · **Systems:** BPA
- **Personas:** PER-ThirdPartyImplementer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given the profile list, when inspected, then each profile lists its clauses and vectors.

## CAP-STD-02 — Conformance vectors

### FR-STD-021 — Language-neutral vectors
- **Statement:** Conformance vectors MUST be data files (inputs, operations, expected outputs and errors) that are independent of implementation language, with a reference runner that drives an implementation through UBTP or an in-process adapter.

- **Rationale:** Conformance is only as good as its coverage.
- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-1 · **Systems:** BPA
- **Personas:** PER-StandardsSteward
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given the traceability index, when checked, then no Must clause lacks vectors.
- **Verification:** INSP
- **Origin:** NEW

### FR-STD-023 — Signed runner reports
- **Statement:** The runner MUST produce reports that include the implementation identity, versions, vectors run and results, signed by the runner's key.

## CAP-STD-03 — Formal models

### FR-STD-031 — Formal models of core semantics

- **Priority:** Must · **Phase:** PH-0 · **Systems:** BPA
- **Personas:** PER-KernelEngineer
- **Acceptance:**
  1. Given the commit and CAS model, when checked, then "no lost update" and "atomic visibility" hold within the bounds.

  - minor releases never break conforming programs, stored data or protocols;
  - major releases have a support window of at least 24 months;
