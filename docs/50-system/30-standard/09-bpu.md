# BPA Standard — The Business Processing Unit (BPU)

A BPU is not a new storage construct. It is the **normative view** that binds the seven
elements of a business unit together. It is the unit that tools, AI and certification
reason about.

## 1. Definition

### STD-BPU-001 — The seven elements
- **Clause:** A BPU class is a concrete class of Definition kind, together with the artefacts bound to it. A BPU instance is an object of such a class. The seven elements MUST map as follows:

  | # | Element | Normative source |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | Class | the class and its linearization (STD-CLS-001, STD-CLS-011) |
  | 2 | State | the object's Definition versions plus the ledger entries whose `source_refs` include the object (STD-KIND-020) |
  | 3 | Clock | the lifecycle (FR-FLOW-011) and the commit cycle (STD-BPU-004) |
  | 4 | Ports | the effective ports (inputs), declared events (outputs) and query ports (reads) |
  | 5 | Governance binding | the governance-sheet blocks and policies whose selectors match the instance (STD-LGS-*) |
  | 6 | Knowledge | the knowledge objects bound to the class chain (FR-AI-051) |
  | 7 | Proof | commit signatures, inclusion proofs and anchors covering the instance's versions and entries (STD-PROOF-*) |
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-2600…2609
- **Satisfies:** UBS-META-06 §4, EXT-BPU
- **Notes:** A Ledger-kind class is not itself a BPU. Its entries are part of the state of the BPUs they reference.

### STD-BPU-002 — BPU descriptor
- **Clause:** An implementation MUST produce, for any BPU class on any branch and time, a `DAT-BpuDescriptor` that is a pure function of the effective definitions involved. Tools, AI tool exposure and certification of Buks MUST use this descriptor.
- **Grammar / Schema:** `DAT-BpuDescriptor`
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-2610…2624
- **Satisfies:** FR-MODEL-101, FR-MODEL-105, FR-AI-041
- **Notes:** —

```yaml
DAT-BpuDescriptor:
  class: { type: text, required: true, description: "class URI and version hash" }
  linearization: { type: list, required: true, description: "class URIs" }
  fields: { type: list, required: true, description: "effective fields with origin class and classification" }
  ledgers: { type: list, required: false, description: "ledger classes that reference this class, with their keys" }
  lifecycle: { type: composite, required: false, description: "states, transitions, guards (effective)" }
  ports: { type: list, required: true, description: "effective ports with signatures, availability states, permission" }
  events: { type: list, required: false, description: "declared event types with payload schemas" }
  governance: { type: list, required: false, description: "properties governable by sheets with their enforcement points" }
  knowledge: { type: list, required: false, description: "knowledge object URIs" }
  proof: { type: composite, required: true, description: "{signed_commits: true, merkle: true, anchoring: boolean}" }
  json_schema: { type: text, required: true, description: "content-id of the generated JSON Schema" }
```

### STD-BPU-003 — Pin discipline
- **Clause:** A BPU instance MUST change state only through its ports (commands) or through governed Definition edits under its class's write policy. Ledger entries referencing it are appended only by port logic or by governed postings. External observation happens only through queries, reads and declared events. There MUST be no other path to its state.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-2625…2634
- **Satisfies:** FR-FLOW-022, AR-004
- **Notes:** This is the "pin-out" property of hardware-ization.

### STD-BPU-004 — The commit cycle
- **Clause:** The state of a BPU instance MUST change only at commit boundaries. Between two commits of its branch, its observable state MUST be constant for all readers (STD-TXN-002, STD-TXN-003).
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-2635…2644
- **Satisfies:** FR-TXN-012
- **Notes:** "One commit is one clock cycle."

### STD-BPU-005 — Governed evolution
- **Clause:** Changes to a BPU class (its class, lifecycle, sheets, logic, views or knowledge) proposed by analysers or agents MUST arrive only as change sets on `evolution` or `agent` branches, and MUST be merged only by non-agent principals (STD-VER-011).
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-2645…2649
- **Satisfies:** FR-AI-102, FR-AI-103
- **Notes:** —

## 2. Hardware-ization properties

### STD-BPU-010 — The six properties
- **Clause:** A conforming implementation MUST exhibit the six properties below. Each is tested through the conformance vectors of the listed clauses.

  | Property | Meaning | Ensured by |
  |---|---|---|
  | Fixed instruction set | logic affects state only through versioned instructions | STD-ISA-001, STD-ISA-002, STD-CTX-003 |
  | Clocked transitions | state changes only at commit boundaries | STD-BPU-004, STD-TXN-003 |
  | Determinism | equal inputs and versions give equal outputs | STD-CTX-010, STD-CTX-011, STD-FND-001 |
  | Pin-out | ports, events and queries are the only interfaces | STD-BPU-003 |
  | Power and timing budgets | every execution is metered and bounded | STD-CTX-004, STD-CTX-005 |
  | Pre-silicon verification | classes and logic are verified before production use | STD-BPU-011, STD-CTX-023 |
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-2650…2659
- **Satisfies:** EXT-BPU
- **Notes:** —

### STD-BPU-011 — BPU class verification
- **Clause:** Before a BPU class version becomes effective on a protected branch, the following MUST hold:
  1. every port implementation is verified (STD-CTX-023);
  2. the lifecycle has no unreachable states and no dead ends other than final states;
  3. every declared event is emitted by at least one port or lifecycle effect;
  4. the class, its fields, ports and states are documented (FR-MODEL-017);
  5. the class's declared test cases and scenarios pass.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-2660…2674
- **Satisfies:** FR-PKG-061, FR-LOGIC-083
