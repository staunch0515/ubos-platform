# BPA Standard — Addressing (ADDR)

### STD-ADDR-001 — Canonical URI
- **Clause:** Objects MUST be addressable by URIs of the form below. Stored references MUST use the canonical form: authority present, no selectors, the class name as it appears in the object's class, and the current slug. Readers MUST follow slug redirects (STD-OBJ-004).
- **Grammar / Schema:**
  ```
  ubos-uri    = "ubos://" authority "/" class-name "/" slug [ "?" selectors ] [ "@v" 1*DIGIT ]
  authority   = tenant [ "." vae ]
  tenant      = slug
  vae         = slug
  selectors   = selector *( "&" selector )
  selector    = ( "branch=" branch-name ) / ( "commit=" content-id ) / ( "tag=" slug )
              / ( "time=" instant ) / ( "asof=" ( date / instant ) ) / ( "key=" slug )
              / ( "view=" mode )
  ```
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-5200…5239
- **Satisfies:** FR-VER-104, FR-TEN-013, FR-MODEL-064
- **Notes:** `@vN` addresses the N-th version on the resolved branch line (1-based). It is a convenience for humans and is never stored.

### STD-ADDR-002 — Selector precedence
- **Clause:** At most one of `commit`, `tag` and `time` MAY be given (`ADDR.CONFLICTING_SELECTORS` otherwise). `branch` defaults to `main`. `asof` combines with any of them. `commit` and `tag` imply their branch. A `branch` selector that disagrees with them MUST be rejected.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-5240…5254
- **Satisfies:** FR-VER-101
- **Notes:** —

### STD-ADDR-003 — Short forms
- **Clause:** Implementations MAY accept short forms as input only: `Class/slug` relative to the context VAE, and `/data/…` VFS paths. They MUST be normalised to canonical URIs before storage or comparison.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-5255…5264
- **Satisfies:** FR-FILE-041
- **Notes:** —

### STD-ADDR-004 — VFS alias mapping
- **Clause:** VFS paths MUST map to canonical URIs as follows:

  | Path prefix | Maps to |
  |---|---|
  | `/data/<namespace>/<Class>/<slug>` | a DataObject instance |
  | `/usr/logic/<namespace>/<name>` | a LogicAsset |
  | `/etc/<namespace>/<name>` | a ConfigAsset instance (sheets, policies, configuration) |
  | `/view/<namespace>/<name>` | a ViewAsset |
  | `/lib/<namespace>/<name>` | a shared library LogicAsset or a Buk-provided reusable object |
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-5265…5279
- **Satisfies:** FR-FILE-041, EXT-TRI
- **Notes:** —

### STD-ADDR-010 — The `did:ubos` method
- **Clause:** Principal identifiers MUST use the DID method `ubos` in one of two forms:
  - **key form** `did:ubos:k:<multibase-base58btc-ed25519-public-key>`, whose DID document is derived from the key (for devices and federation bootstrap);
  - **registered form** `did:ubos:<authority>:<uuid>`, whose DID document (verification methods with validity periods, service endpoints) is served by the owning node and, in federation, by the registry.

  Key rotation MUST append verification methods with validity periods and MUST NOT delete history.
- **Grammar / Schema:**
  ```
  ubos-did   = "did:ubos:" ( key-form / reg-form )
  key-form   = "k:" "z" 1*BASE58
  reg-form   = authority ":" uuid
  ```
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-5280…5309
- **Satisfies:** FR-IAM-032, FR-IAM-033, FR-SYNC-051
- **Notes:** EXT-RFC used `did:ubos:<ed25519-public-key>`. That corresponds to the key form.
