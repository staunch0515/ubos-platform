# BPA Standard — State Kinds (KIND)

| Kind | Versioned per branch | Merge | Valid time | Written by | Correction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Definition | yes | three-way (STD-VER-050) | period per version | commit instructions | new version |
| Ledger `[Profile: Ledger]` | append-only per ledger key | append (STD-VER-054) | instant or date per entry | `commit.append`, `commit.reverse`, `commit.adjust` | reversal or adjustment |
| System | yes (kernel services only) | not merged; branch-local | none | kernel services and dedicated instructions | kernel state transitions |
| RawDocument | yes | whole-value (conflict if both sides changed) | period | commit instructions | new version |

## 1. Definition kind

### STD-KIND-001 — Definition semantics
- **Clause:** Objects of Definition kind MUST follow STD-OBJ-002. Every version carries a valid-time period, and versions participate in diff, three-way merge and revert. Updates MUST name a base version (STD-TXN-020).
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-1000…1009
- **Satisfies:** FR-MODEL-052
- **Notes:** —

## 2. Ledger kind `[Profile: Ledger]`

### STD-KIND-020 — Ledger entry schema
- **Clause:** Each ledger entry MUST conform to `DAT-LedgerEntry`. Its entry hash is computed over the canonical entry with domain tag `ubos.entry.v1`, excluding `seq` and `source_seq`, which are assigned by the branch. Entries are immutable after commit.
- **Grammar / Schema:** `DAT-LedgerEntry`
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-1020…1039
- **Satisfies:** FR-MODEL-053, FR-LEDG-011, FR-LEDG-012
- **Notes:** Excluding the sequence from the hash lets the same entry be appended on another branch after a merge without changing its identity.

```yaml
DAT-LedgerEntry:
  entry_id: { type: text, required: true, description: "UUID of the entry" }
  class: { type: text, required: true, description: "ledger class URI" }
  class_version: { type: text, required: true, description: "content-id of the class version" }
  ledger_key: { type: map, required: true, description: "values of the declared ledger key fields" }
  seq: { type: integer, required: true, description: "branch-assigned sequence within the ledger key (1-based, gap-free)" }
  source_seq: { type: composite, required: false, description: "{branch, seq} on the branch where first appended, after merges" }
  valid_at: { type: text, required: true, description: "date or instant of business effect" }
  body_ref: { type: text, required: true, description: "content-id of the body (amounts and other fields)" }
  corrects: { type: list, required: false, description: "entry_ids corrected by this entry" }
  correction_type: { type: enum, required: false, description: "reversal | adjustment | repost" }
  posting_group: { type: text, required: false, description: "group id for double-entry balancing" }
  source_refs: { type: list, required: false, description: "canonical URIs of originating objects" }
```

### STD-KIND-021 — Append-only enforcement
- **Clause:** The only instructions that create ledger entries MUST be `commit.append`, `commit.reverse` and `commit.adjust`. Any update or end instruction targeting an entry MUST fail with `LEDG.IMMUTABLE_ENTRY`.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-1040…1049
- **Satisfies:** FR-LEDG-012, FR-MODEL-053
- **Notes:** —

### STD-KIND-022 — Gap-free sequences
- **Clause:** On each branch, entries of one `(class, ledger_key)` MUST be numbered 1, 2, 3, … in commit order, without gaps or duplicates, including under concurrent appends and crashes. A sequence number becomes visible only with the commit that assigns it.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-1050…1069
- **Satisfies:** FR-LEDG-041, FR-LEDG-042
- **Notes:** Implementations typically allocate sequences inside the flush transaction from a locked counter (DEC-020).

### STD-KIND-023 — Reversal
- **Clause:** `commit.reverse(entry_id, reason)` MUST append an entry with every amount field negated, `corrects = [entry_id]`, `correction_type = reversal`, and `valid_at` equal to the original's unless specified. An entry that is already reversed MUST NOT be reversed again (`LEDG.ALREADY_REVERSED`). A reversal entry MUST NOT be reversed (`LEDG.REVERSAL_NOT_REVERSIBLE`).
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-1070…1084
- **Satisfies:** FR-LEDG-021, FR-LEDG-023
- **Notes:** —

### STD-KIND-024 — Double entry
- **Clause:** For ledger classes with `double_entry: true`, all entries sharing a `posting_group` within one commit MUST balance (the sum of signed amounts is zero per currency). Otherwise the commit MUST fail with `LEDG.UNBALANCED`.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-1085…1094
- **Satisfies:** FR-LEDG-051
- **Notes:** —

### STD-KIND-025 — Periods
- **Clause:** A ledger class MAY declare a `period_scope`. Period objects with states `open`, `closing` and `closed` then govern the entries whose posting date falls in them. Appends with a posting date in a `closed` period MUST fail with `LEDG.PERIOD_CLOSED`. The posting date is the date of the commit's transaction time in the VAE business time zone, unless the class declares a posting-date field.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-1095…1109
- **Satisfies:** FR-LEDG-061
- **Notes:** —

## 3. System kind

### STD-KIND-040 — System-kind objects
- **Clause:** Objects of System kind MUST be written only by kernel services and by instructions dedicated to them (for example `emit.event` creates delivery jobs). Generic `commit.*` instructions targeting System-kind objects MUST fail with `LOGIC.FORBIDDEN_TARGET`. System-kind objects are branch-local and never merged.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-1120…1129
- **Satisfies:** FR-MODEL-054
- **Notes:** —

## 4. RawDocument kind

### STD-KIND-060 — RawDocument semantics
- **Clause:** Bodies of RawDocument objects MAY be any canonical JSON within size limits. Only envelope fields and fields declared on the class are validated. L1 expressions, selectors, projections and ports MUST NOT reference undeclared content paths (`RULE.UNTYPED_ACCESS`). A declared parser (L2 or L3) MAY read the content and produce typed objects. On merge, a RawDocument conflicts whenever both sides changed its body.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-1140…1154
- **Satisfies:** FR-MODEL-055
- **Notes:** —

## 5. Kind stability

### STD-KIND-080 — Immutable kind
- **Clause:** A class's kind MUST NOT change once any object of the class, or of any subclass, exists on any branch of the VAE (`MODEL.KIND_IMMUTABLE`).
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-1160…1164
- **Satisfies:** FR-MODEL-056
- **Notes:** —
