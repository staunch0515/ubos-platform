# BPA Standard — Instruction Set (ISA) — General Rules

The instruction set is the fixed "hardware" interface through which logic affects
business state. ABI version 1.0 is specified here.

| File | Families |
|---|---|
| `00-index.md` | general rules |
| `01-commit-read.md` | `commit.*`, `read.*` |
| `02-run-emit.md` | `run.*`, `emit.*` |
| `03-search-call-ask.md` | `search.*`, `call.*`, `ask.*` |

## 1. Instruction descriptor

### STD-ISA-001 — Instruction descriptor
- **Clause:** Every instruction MUST be described by a `DAT-InstructionDecl`. The set of descriptors of an ABI version is normative, and implementations MUST NOT expose other instructions to logic, except registered extensions (STD-CONF-*).
- **Grammar / Schema:** `DAT-InstructionDecl`
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-3000…3009
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-011, FR-LOGIC-013
- **Notes:** —

```yaml
DAT-InstructionDecl:
  name: { type: text, required: true, description: "family.operation" }
  since: { type: text, required: true, description: "ABI version introduced" }
  params: { type: list, required: true, description: "parameter declarations (value types)" }
  result: { type: text, required: true, description: "result type" }
  errors: { type: list, required: true, description: "error codes" }
  determinism: { type: enum, required: true, description: "pure | snapshot | journaled | deferred" }
  cost: { type: composite, required: true, description: "{base: units, per_item: units}" }
  authorization: { type: text, required: true, description: "policy action evaluated" }
  profiles: { type: list, required: true, description: "execution profiles where available" }
```

### STD-ISA-002 — ABI versioning
- **Clause:** The ABI version has the form `MAJOR.MINOR`. A minor version MUST only add instructions, optional parameters, result members or error codes. A logic asset declares `abi = M.m`, and implementations supporting `M.n` with `n ≥ m` MUST execute it with the `M.m` semantics. A major version MUST be supported for at least 24 months after its successor's release.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-3010…3019
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-012, NR-COMPAT-001
- **Notes:** —

### STD-ISA-003 — Determinism classes
- **Clause:** Each instruction belongs to exactly one determinism class:

  | Class | Meaning | Journal |
  |---|---|---|
  | `pure` | the result depends only on the arguments | none |
  | `snapshot` | the result depends on the arguments and the process snapshot | the snapshot commit IDs (once per branch) |
  | `journaled` | the result depends on the outside world (clock, entropy, connectors, models) | the result is journaled before it is returned |
  | `deferred` | the effect is released after commit (outbox) | effect IDs |
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-3020…3029
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-071, FR-LOGIC-072
- **Notes:** —

### STD-ISA-004 — Metering units
- **Clause:** Every instruction MUST charge its declared cost in *units* against the execution's operation budget, in addition to the script operations and component fuel of the calling tier. Version 1.0 defines 1 unit ≈ one script operation. The costs in the family files are normative minimums for conformance of budget exhaustion.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-3030…3039
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-061, FR-LOGIC-063
- **Notes:** —

### STD-ISA-005 — Authorization at every instruction
- **Clause:** Before executing, every instruction MUST evaluate its authorization action with the execution context's principal chain against the target resource (STD-CTX-001). Denials MUST raise `IAM.DENIED`, or `IAM.NOT_FOUND` for invisible resources, and are not catchable as success.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-3040…3049
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-014, FR-IAM-041, FR-IAM-043
- **Notes:** —

### STD-ISA-006 — Errors raised by instructions
- **Clause:** Instructions raise errors using the uniform error object (AR-026):
  - business errors (`catchable: true`) MAY be caught by logic;
  - limit, cancellation and integrity errors (`catchable: false`) MUST terminate the execution.

  The catchability of each code is defined in the error registry (STD-ERR).
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-3050…3059
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-044, FR-LOGIC-062
- **Notes:** —

### STD-ISA-007 — Tier neutrality
- **Clause:** Instruction semantics MUST be identical whether invoked from L2 scripts, L3 components or an in-process host adapter. Host bindings map the descriptors one-to-one: Rhai functions under the `sys` object, WIT interface `ubos:isa/v1` functions, and the Rust host API.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-3060…3069
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-015
- **Notes:** —
