# BPA Standard — L1 Expressions and Queries (EXPR)

## 1. Expression language

### STD-EXPR-001 — Grammar
- **Clause:** L1 expressions MUST conform to the grammar below. Whitespace is insignificant between tokens.
- **Grammar / Schema:**
  ```
  expr        = cond
  cond        = or-expr [ "?" expr ":" expr ]
  or-expr     = and-expr *( "or" and-expr )
  and-expr    = not-expr *( "and" not-expr )
  not-expr    = [ "not" ] cmp-expr
  cmp-expr    = add-expr [ cmp-op add-expr / "in" list-lit / "in" path / "is" [ "not" ] "null" / "matches" string ]
  cmp-op      = "==" / "!=" / "<" / "<=" / ">" / ">="
  add-expr    = mul-expr *( ( "+" / "-" ) mul-expr )
  mul-expr    = unary *( ( "*" / "/" / "%" ) unary )
  unary       = [ "-" ] postfix
  postfix     = primary *( "." member / "?." member / "[" expr "]" )
  primary     = literal / path / call / lambda-call / "(" expr ")"
  call        = fname "(" [ expr *( "," expr ) ] ")"
  lambda-call = coll-fn "(" expr "," ident "->" expr ")"
  coll-fn     = "any" / "all" / "count" / "sum" / "min" / "max" / "filter" / "map" / "first"
  path        = ( "this" / "ctx" / "params" / "old" / ident ) *( "." member )
  literal     = number / string / "true" / "false" / "null" / date-lit / money-lit / list-lit
  date-lit    = "d'" date "'" / "t'" instant "'"
  money-lit   = decimal-lit currency-code        ; e.g. 1000.00USD
  list-lit    = "[" [ expr *( "," expr ) ] "]"
  ```
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-4400…4459
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-031, FR-LOGIC-034
- **Notes:** `this` is the object, `old` is its base version in commit-time rules, `params` are port parameters, and `ctx` is the execution context (read-only members only).

### STD-EXPR-002 — Typing
- **Clause:** Expressions MUST be statically typed against the effective model:
  - arithmetic on `integer` and `decimal` promotes to `decimal`;
  - `money ± money` requires equal currency (checked at run time when currencies are not static);
  - `money × decimal` gives `money`;
  - comparisons require compatible types;
  - `date - date` gives an integer number of days;
  - `instant - instant` gives a `duration`.

  Type errors MUST be reported at authoring with position (`LOGIC.TYPE_ERROR`).
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-4460…4499
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-033
- **Notes:** —

### STD-EXPR-003 — Null semantics
- **Clause:** Evaluation MUST use three-valued logic for comparisons involving `null` (the result is `null`), and `and`/`or` with SQL truth tables. A guard or validation whose result is `null` MUST be treated as `false` for guards and as "not violated" for validations. `?.` returns `null` when the receiver is `null`. Arithmetic with `null` gives `null`.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-4500…4519
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-031
- **Notes:** Authors use `is null` checks for explicit semantics.

### STD-EXPR-004 — Totality and bounds
- **Clause:** Expressions MUST always terminate: there is no recursion and no user-defined functions, and collection functions iterate over finite lists bounded by `max_items`. Evaluation MUST be charged to the operation budget. Division by zero MUST raise `LOGIC.DIVISION_BY_ZERO`. Decimal division MUST use the target field's scale, or the explicit `div(a, b, scale, rounding)` function.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-4520…4539
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-031, STD-FND-022
- **Notes:** —

### STD-EXPR-005 — Standard function library (ABI 1.0)
- **Clause:** Implementations MUST provide these functions with the semantics defined by their vectors:

  | Group | Functions |
  |---|---|
  | Text | `len`, `lower`, `upper`, `trim`, `substr`, `concat`, `contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `replace`, `pad_left`, `format` |
  | Numbers | `abs`, `round(x, scale, mode)`, `floor`, `ceil`, `div`, `min`, `max`, `clamp` |
  | Money | `amount`, `currency`, `money(amount, cur)`, `convert(m, cur, rate_ref)`, `allocate(m, weights)` |
  | Dates | `today()` (business time zone), `now()`, `date(y, m, d)`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `weekday`, `add_days`, `add_months` (end-of-month rule), `days_between`, `start_of_month`, `end_of_month`, `to_zone(instant, tz)` |
  | Calendars | `is_business_day(d, cal)`, `add_business_days(d, n, cal)`, `next_business_day`, `previous_business_day`, `cutoff(d, time, tz, cal)` |
  | Periods | `contains(period, d)`, `overlaps(p1, p2)`, `period(from, to)` |
  | Collections | `any`, `all`, `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `filter`, `map`, `first`, `distinct`, `sort_by` |
  | References | `ref(uri)` (read at the same coordinates, charged as `read.get`), `exists(uri)` |
  | Identifiers | `luhn_valid`, `iso7064_mod97_10`, `isin_valid`, `lei_valid`, `iban_valid` |
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-4540…4699
- **Satisfies:** FR-LOGIC-035, FR-LOC-041, FR-LOC-042, FR-MODEL-046
- **Notes:** Buk-registered pure functions extend the library under namespaced names (FR-LOGIC-035).

## 2. Query form

### STD-EXPR-010 — Criteria query object
- **Clause:** Criteria queries MUST be expressed as `DAT-Query`. The textual form is `from <Class> [only] where <expr> order by <path> [asc|desc], … limit n`. Both forms MUST be equivalent.
- **Grammar / Schema:** `DAT-Query`
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-4700…4749
- **Satisfies:** FR-QRY-011, FR-QRY-072
- **Notes:** —

```yaml
DAT-Query:
  from: { type: text, required: true, description: "class URI or name" }
  only: { type: boolean, required: false, description: "exclude subclasses" }
  where: { type: text, required: false, description: "L1 boolean expression over `this`" }
  states: { type: list, required: false, description: "lifecycle states" }
  select: { type: list, required: false, description: "field paths to return (default all visible)" }
  order_by: { type: list, required: false, description: "{path, dir}; the object id is appended as a tie-breaker" }
  group_by: { type: list, required: false, description: "paths (aggregate queries)" }
  aggregates: { type: list, required: false, description: "{fn, path, as}" }
  limit: { type: integer, required: false, description: "page size (default 100, max 1000)" }
  cursor: { type: text, required: false, description: "opaque; binds the snapshot" }
```

### STD-EXPR-011 — Query evaluation rules
- **Clause:**
  - Queries MUST evaluate against one snapshot per branch, which is bound into the cursor.
  - Row visibility and masking are applied during evaluation.
  - A `where` over masked fields MUST evaluate on masked values, so that no inference through filtering is possible.
  - Paths through references resolve at the query's coordinates.
- **Grammar / Schema:** —
- **Conformance vectors:** VER-CONF-4750…4779
- **Satisfies:** FR-QRY-012, FR-QRY-071, FR-TIME-032
- **Notes:** —
